Applies a turn limit to a game of Warzone and calculates the winner of the game at the end of the turns to be the player with the most income and points from wars.

Points are gained by killing armies and are weighted by the strength of the players. This encourages players of equal strength to fight one another and keeps games among friends from becoming a game of avoiding conflict.
