# About
This is a set of mods for the browser and mobile game [Warzone](https://www.warzone.com).

## Board Game Warzone
This mod is designed to give Warzone more of a board game like feel and encourage fighting in a highly diplomatic setting (a bunch of friends in a Zoom call for instance). The number of turns is limited and the winner is assigned based off ending income and points earned from killing armies.

This mod is still a work in progress although multi-player testing is beginning.
